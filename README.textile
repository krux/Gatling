h2. Overview

Provides a framework for using non-asynchronous tracking pixles asynchronously. Using gatling, almost any third party blocking tracking pixel can be reliably fired after the DomReady event, meaning that you can implement as many trackers as you need without it impacting the performance of your webpages. It is recommended you use this plugin with "jQuery 1.4.2":http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.4.2/jquery.js
